Requirements - https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html
You need to use python 3.8
```
pip install lipd
pip install ipywidgets
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```

1. Using Conditinal Probabilities and Bayesian rules to compute the value for ProxyObservationType and Inferred Variable Type given the ArchiveType.
2. Read the csv file created by reading all the lipd files.
3. The data needs a lot of cleaning for efficient predictions.
4. Using ipywidgets to generate a simulation of the entire process.
